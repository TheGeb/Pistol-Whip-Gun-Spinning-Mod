# Pistol-Whip-Gun-Spinning-Mod

Add some extra style to the game with this mod!

### Notes:
  - Shooting while spinning the gun will shoot in the direction you point in real life (and make the gun spin slightly faster)
  - You can do slick spin-reloads!
  - Activate the spin by letting go of the grip button. For people with the valve index/knuckles controllers, you'll want to rebind "Grip Touch" to "Grip Button". I've also published my bindings which do exactly that through the SteamVR Bindings UI.
Requires MelonLoader

### Planned changes/features: 
- adjusting rotation point to be around the finger
- add user-customizable fields for spin speed/dampening, etc
